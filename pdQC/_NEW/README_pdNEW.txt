Some of the programs in the pacsDisplay package
create file related to display monitor characteristics.
These include:
                EDIDprofile
                lumResponse
                lutGenerate
                uLRstats
By default, these files are created in the _NEW folder.
For pacsDisplay, this directory is in the LUT-Library folder.
For pdQC, it is in the pdQC folder.

The location of the _NEW folder is defined in the
getInstalledPaths.txt file within the BIN folder
for each program.
